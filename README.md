# Neural Network Basics

This project was a study to understand how a neural network works.

Usually, those things are implemented in Python, but I wanted to push me to think more while coding, take one step forward, and use Golang for that.

I used the following article to understand how it neural network works, understand the calculations, and then applied it to this project.

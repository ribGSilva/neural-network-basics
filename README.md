# Neural Network Basics

This project was a study to understand how a neural network woks.

Usually, those things are implemented in Python, but I wanted to force me to think while coding and take one step forward and use golang for that.

This is a neural network that uses 

I followed this gid article, followed every understanding, and applied it here.
